# The Zoomies

The Zoomies is a sidescroller inspired by my cat Django. If you own a cat you know that they sometimes randomly get a lot of energy and just start running around the house all excited and ready to play. This behavior is popularly called "The Zoomies", hence the title.

Bugs still to work out:
- Double jump. I have not found a way to remove double jump.
- Sprite hit is too wide. Could not figure out how to make smaller in javascript. In an updated version, I'll need to reduce the size manually on the sprite sheet.

Stuff to add:
- Enemies/Obstacles
- Additional levels that gradually become harder
