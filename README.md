# The Zoomies

The Zoomies is a sidescroller inspired by my cat Django. If you own a cat you know that they sometimes randomly get a lot of energy and just start running around the house all excited and ready to play. This behavior is popularly called "The Zoomies", hence the title.

Bugs:
- Sometimes starts weird and requires refresh.
- If you go forward enough, you can turn back and run off the edge to the left near the starting point.
- I have not found a way to remove double jump.
- Sprite hit box is too wide. Could not figure out how to make smaller in javascript. In an updated version, I'll need to reduce the size manually on the sprite sheet.
- When facing left, the sprite animation seems to be faster? I'm not sure what is causing it.


To Add in Future Updates:
- Enemies/Obstacles
- Additional levels that gradually become harder
- Add jump/fall animations
- Better organization of platforms in app.js
- Make platform images prettier
